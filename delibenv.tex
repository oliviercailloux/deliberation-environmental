\commentYM{à ajuster en fonction de nos modifications, pas encore touché} A voluminous literature addresses the weaknesses of standard stated preference methods used to value non-market environmental goods and services, such as contingent valuation and choice experiment. 
Deliberative monetary valuation (DMV) has emerged as a prominent alternative to the standard versions of these methods. It combines deliberative institutions with preference elicitation. 
Despite an anchorage in an extensive philosophical literature on deliberative democracy, the theoretical foundations of DMV are underinvestigated.  
A noteworthy exception is \citet{bartkowski_beyond_2018}’s effort to use \citeauthor{sen_idea_2009}’s philosophical views to elaborate such theoretical foundations. 
The present article pursues this theoretical effort by pointing out two issues left unanswered by the above contribution: 
the first issue is the precise role that deliberation is expected to play in DMV and, more broadly, in environmental decision-making (we term this the \emph{aim of the deliberation} issue); 
the second issue is the role that economists and consultants involved in the proceedings of deliberation are supposed to play (we term this the \emph{role of the analyst} issue). 
In order to clarify the kind of investigations that DMV or any alternative method should implement to be unequivocal on these issues, we use a formal framework introduced by \citet{cailloux_formal_2019}, designed to capture the stance that an individual has on a given topic once she has participated in a deliberation: her “deliberated judgment”. 
This framework allows to identify empirical questions that DMV do not tackle whereas answering these questions would be necessary to clarify the stance that DMV takes on the \emph{aim of the deliberation} issue. 
When it comes to the \emph{role of the analyst} issue, our framework advocates an active role of the practitioner in creating what we call models of \aclp{DJ}. 
This framework helps to characterize the normative stance adopted when implementing a deliberative approach.

\section{Introduction}
A voluminous literature now addresses the practical, methodological and philosophical weaknesses of the standard \ac{SPM} used to value non-market environmental goods and services by eliciting individual \ac{WTP} \citep{meinard_ethical_2016}. 
As summarized by \cite{bartkowski_beyond_2018} and \cite{bartkowski_deliberative_2019}, the most important criticisms addressed at these methods raise two political and ethical concerns. 
The first one, articulated in terms of the consumer-citizen dichotomy, refers to the idea that \ac{SPM} would discourage respondents from acting as citizens, in particular by taking into account the social implications of their  choices and statements \citep{soma_representing_2014, vatn_institutional_2009}. 
The second concern is that \ac{SPM} ignore the reasons underlying respondents’ statements or choices, whereas understanding those reasons is, according to some authors like \citet{sen_environmental_1995}, perhaps even more relevant and important than the statements and choices themselves. A further concern is that respondents typically need time and thinking before they can form a meaningful answer about their \ac{WTP} for such subtle matters as environmental questions, but standard \ac{SPM} do not consider ways of helping respondents to form their preferences.

A prominent alternative to standard \ac{SPM} has emerged in the past 15 years: \ac{DMV} \citep{spash_deliberative_2007,bartkowski_economic_2017}. 
These methods combine deliberative institutions, such as focus groups, with preference elicitation or choice experiments. 
The emerging literature on these methods suggests that they have important strengths as compared with standard \ac{SPM}, at several levels. 
At a practical level, it appears that respondents find it easier to make sense of these methods, and are less likely to refuse to answer \citep{lienhoop_contingent_2007,szabo_reducing_2011}. 
At a philosophical level, the very label of these methods, and the deliberative institutions on which they are based, refer to the notion of deliberative democracy, which has been extensively investigated since the 1970 and now largely dominates the political philosophical scene \citep{chappell_deliberative_2012}.

Despite this anchorage in the philosophy of deliberative democracy, the theoretical foundations of \ac{DMV} are arguably underinvestigated \citep{bartkowski_economic_2017,bartkowski_beyond_2018,bunse_what_2015,kenter_what_2015}. 
A noteworthy exception is \citet{bartkowski_beyond_2018}’s pioneering effort to use \citet{sen_idea_2009}’s philosophical views to elaborate such theoretical foundations. 
Although \citet{bartkowski_beyond_2018} articulate convincing solutions to some important issues in the foundations of these methods, they also leave aside some prominent theoretical problems. 
Our aim in this article is to highlight the importance of two of these remaining problems, and to outline avenues for their resolution.

A first problem is that the literature on \ac{DMV} fails to clarify how one can ascertain that deliberation has attained its intended goal. Most studies in the literature endorse either of the following two understandings of the goal of deliberation. Some studies are “substantive”, in the sense that they understand deliberation as aimed at helping respondents to form informed and stable preferences. Others are “normative”, in the sense that they see deliberation as a way to democratize decision making and open it to value pluralism (\cite{schaafsma_guidance_2018} pinpoint these two classical views, but add a third approach, called “instrumental”, which uses deliberation as a means to achieve particular, independently defined, policy goals). In either case, the literature does not indicate means to ascertain whether the intended goal has been attained. This is, however, far from trivial.

A prominent, but ultimately flawed, candidate criterion to monitor the achievements of deliberation is whether it allows achieving a consensus. Some authors claim that the point of exchanges of arguments and interactions during deliberation is to reach a mutual understanding of environmental problems and to identify a common solution \citep{vatn_institutional_2009}, or even a single social \ac{WTP} \citep{orchard-webb_deliberative_2016}. The underlying idea that deliberation is conducive to consensus is often presented as a basic tenet of deliberative democracy theory \citep{wilson_discourse-based_2002}. 

However, this consensus based approach is now largely discredited. Indeed, it is challenged by two important objections.
The first one is that there can exist deep moral disagreements \citep{dryzek_deliberative_2013} between some people or groups, and it might prove impossible or not desirable to heal such disagreements.
The second one is that unanimity can reflect exclusion and power dynamics \citep{elster_sour_1983,volker_exploring_2016,vargas_background_2016,vargas_problem_2017,murphy_comparing_2017} rather than a normatively meaningful convergence of views.
\citeauthor{bartkowski_beyond_2018} contrast this consensus tenet with the notion of a “plurality of impartial reasons” championed by \citet{sen_idea_2009}.
This stance leads them to defend an approach to \ac{DMV} where consensus is neither required nor expected.

In a vision in which there is consensus if and only if there is enough deliberation, observing consensus, or the lack thereof, permits to determine whether there has been enough deliberation of the right sort.
But as soon as one acknowledges that consensus can also be generated by brute force and that deliberation can leave room to dissensus, observing a consensus loses its relevance. 
How, then, can one assess the deliberative credentials of a given \ac{DMV}? 
\citeauthor{bartkowski_beyond_2018} neither raise nor answer this question.
%\citeauthor{bartkowski_beyond_2018} notice that, in an approach such as theirs, an aggregation mechanism is needed \emph{after} the deliberative step.
%However, they do not properly discuss the aggregation issue: they highlight the usefulness of additive aggregation of individual \ac{WTP}, “for lack of better alternatives”, but do not investigate if and how using this aggregation rule could possibly solve the problem. % (a possible line of argument, which they do not develop, could be to argue that disagreeing people could all agree that their disagreements should be solved thanks to an additive aggregation; but this argument would require further development).
There is hence a need to articulate much more clearly how it can be ascertained that deliberation has attained its goal. This is what we call the issue of the \emph{deliberative credentials} of \ac{DMV}.

This first blindspot of the literature on \ac{DMV} is associated with a second one. The literature on deliberative democracy, and especially the writings of its founding fathers, \citet{rawls_political_2005} and \citet{habermas_faktizitat_1992}, place emphasis on questioning the \emph{stance} that philosophers take when they state the tenets of moral or political theories \citep{meinard_du_2014}. This leads them to address questions such as: How far can they go when they express their own views? Is it legitimate for them to provide others with information? Would it be legitimate for them to highlight mistakes in the reasoning that others express? And so on.
By contrast, the literature on \ac{DMV} appears strikingly silent about the stance of economists and consultants involved in the proceedings of deliberation as part of \ac{DMV}, as if they were transparent and neutral observers. Even practice-oriented detailed contributions such as \citet{schaafsma_guidance_2018} limit themselves to pointing out that economists implementing \ac{DMV} studies should have moderation skills, but do not explore the practical counterparts of Rawls’s and Habermas’s inquiries into the proper role of philosophers. 
This stands in stark contrast, not only with the philosophical literature on deliberation, but also with the practice of decision support, which typically emphasizes the importance of decision support interactions that consist, for the analyst, in ensuring that the aided individuals understand and accept the reasoning on which decision support is based. 
This is what we term the \emph{role of the analyst} issue.

So far, the pioneering research on \ac{DMV} and associated methodological problems have been mainly developed in the context of environmental issues, and published in journals in economics of the environment. However, the scope of the \emph{deliberative credentials} and the \emph{role of the analyst} issues is clearly larger than \ac{DMV}, and even larger than \emph{environmental} issues. In the present article, we tackle this problem at a general level, without any specific reference to environmental issues. Our aim is to introduce an approach to strengthen \ac{DMV} by explicitly addressing \emph{deliberative credentials} and the \emph{role of the analyst} issues. In section 2, we take advantage of a formal framework introduced by \citet{cailloux_formal_2019} to address the challenges raised by these two issues.
In section 3, we ponder on the philosophical meaning of our contribution and we pinpoint empirical challenges that our proposed approach raises for the future of deliberative methods.

\section{A formal framework to address the \emph{deliberative credentials} and the \emph{role of the analyst} issues in deliberative methods}
In this section, we present, in a very simplified form, the formal framework proposed by \citet{cailloux_formal_2019}, and we show how such a framework can strengthen the foundations of deliberative approaches by clearly addressing the two issues above.

\subsection{Formal definitions to address the \emph{deliberative credentials} issue}
%The aim of the above-cited framework is to carve out a formal representation of an individual’s stance on a given issue once he has participated in a deliberation. 
 \commentYM{comme prévu, je te laisse tenter ici une reformulation de l'appareil formel}

Typically, deliberation is, informally, attached to many \emph{prima facie} desirable properties of discussions or stances that people reach thanks to discussions, such as consistency, transparency, informativeness, among others. However, the above terms can have multiple meanings, and in some understandings the corresponding properties can have contradictory implications. Clarifying, in formal terms, the aim of deliberation is therefore useful. Our proposal for this clarification is that the reference to deliberation (which we will call, following \citet{cailloux_formal_2019}, the individual’s \ac{DJ} \commentOCf{Cette parenthèse devrait être retirée et clarifier ce qu’on appelle DJ (≠ délibération !). C’est lié aux discussions qui suivent.}\commentYM{ge ahead, je n'ai pas vraiment compris comment tu envisageais d'introduire le concept et la notation}) captures two central ideas.

The first idea is that \acp{DJ} are the result of a careful examination of arguments and counter-arguments: through deliberation, the individual gathers new information, learns about the viewpoints of other people, and takes the time to think about all these elements, 
which are all arguments for or against this or that stance. 
This idea echoes the approach to the notion of rationality developed by \citet{habermas_theorie_1981}.
In his approach, actions, attitudes or utterances are rational if and only if the actor performing or having them can account for them, explain them and use arguments and counter-arguments to withstand criticisms that other people could raise against them. 
Variants of this vision of rationality play a key role in other prominent philosophical frameworks, such as \citeauthor{scanlon_what_2000}’s \citeyearpar{scanlon_what_2000} and \citeauthor{sen_idea_2009}’s \citeyearpar{sen_idea_2009}. 
%(Using Sen’s vocabulary, \citeauthor{bartkowski_beyond_2018} talk about “reasonableness” to stress the interpersonal aspect of this idea. 
%This choice of vocabulary can create confusions, because the term “reasonable” is more classically associated with \citet{rawls_political_2005}, who understands this term in a different sense.) 
For simplicity’s sake, we will simply talk about “rationality” to refer to this first idea. %: the \ac{DJ} of an individual is a judgment that considers all relevant arguments.
In this manuscript, when using the term "rationality", we mean it in the wide sense described in this paragraph, in contrast to the narrow version of rationality used in a part of the economic literature.

The second idea is that \acp{DJ} are nevertheless the individual’s own judgments, in the sense that they do not reflect the application of any exogenous criterion. 
This second idea will be nicknamed “anti-paternalism” in what follows.

Notice that, by saying that the reference to deliberation captures the two ideas of rationality and anti-paternalism, we reject a view of deliberation which might, at first sight, be self-evidently relevant, but is untenable after all. This idea is that exchanging arguments in discussions with other people is a value in itself that underlies, and perhaps even exhausts, the reasons one can have to champion deliberation. This idea can be summarized by saying that discussion is simply valuable in itself, and this is the reason why deliberation is valuable. This idea is untenable because, as recalled above, it is established that group discussions involve power dynamics and that language can be a rhetorical manipulative tool. Therefore, discussions cannot be unequivocally considered to be valuable in themselves. Discussions encompass different aspects, some of which clearly represent disvalues. If one wants to champion the value of discussion, one therefore has to analyse discussions as complex wholes, to identify valuable aspects in them, liable to outweigh the above disvalues. This is what our proposal does: we claim that discussions are valuable to the extent that they allow fostering rationality and anti-paternalism. An obvious correlate of our claim is that if rationality and anti-paternalism can be achieved without the kind of informal talks that one calls “discussions” in everyday life, then these “discussions” will be dispensable, and deliberation will have happened nonetheless.

Notice also that our approach can accommodate both substantive and normative understandings of the aim of deliberation. In the substantive view, rational and anti-paternalistic preferences are good in themselves. In the normative view, helping people to form rational and anti-paternalistic preference is a democratic endeavour.

To formalize these ideas, let us assume that a decision-maker is given -- call her $i$ -- together with a topic $\allprops$, about which $i$ wants to make up her mind. 
Let us then define $\allargs$ as a set that contains all the arguments that one can make use of when trying to make up one’s mind about $\allprops$.
Elaborate typologies of the kinds of arguments involved in environmental deliberations have been developed in the literature, for example by \citet{chateauraynaud_contrainte_2007}. 
By using here a very abstract notion of argument, we aim to encompass all the diversity included in such typologies. 

Using these notions, we want to define $i$’s stance towards the topic once a deliberation has allowed her to ponder all the arguments possibly relevant to the situation, so has to reach her pondered (rational) own (anti-paternalistic) stance. 
Thus, we want to study changes of mind of $i$, or the lack thereof.

This is done by defining three relations, which we assume are partially observable. We say that an argument $\ar$ supports a proposition $\prop \in T$ when $i$ declares that $\ar$ is an argument in favor of the proposition. We say that an argument $\ar$ \emph{sometimes trumps} another argument $\ar'$ when $i$ sometimes declares, upon seeing $\ar$, that in her current state of mind, $\ar'$ is not a valid argument for some of the propositions it claims to support. We use the word “sometimes” because $i$ may change her mind during the process of being confronted with various arguments: she might initially, for example, state that $\ar$ does not trump $\ar'$, but then, after having seen a third argument which lets her better understand the content of $\ar$, declare that $\ar$ trumps $\ar'$. Finally, we say that an argument $\ar$ sometimes does not trump another argument $\ar'$ when $i$ sometimes declares, upon seeing $\ar$, that in her current state of mind, $\ar'$ is a valid argument for all the propositions it claims to support, and a valid argument against all the arguments it claims to trump. (Thus, in the previous example, it would hold that $\ar$ sometimes trumps $\ar'$ and $\ar$ sometimes does not trump $\ar'$.)

These relations permit to define $i$'s \ac{DJ}: it consists of the propositions that are supported by at least one argument $\ar$ that is never trumped by any other argument (thus, an argument $\ar$ such that it never holds that $\ar'$ sometimes trumps $\ar$, for any $\ar'$ in $\allargs$). Those propositions are called acceptable. This definition echoes \possessivecite{rawls_political_2005} emphasis on the requirement of \emph{acceptability} by reasonable citizens. 

%We repeat here (with minor modifications) a remark from the companion article defining these notions, as it links these definitions to the literature in philosophy and rhetorics. 
%\begin{remark}
%Notice also that, according to our definition, it is possible for a proposition $\prop$ to be acceptable and for not-$\prop$, or more generally for any proposition $\prop'$ in logical contradiction with $\prop$ or having empirical incompatibilities with $\prop$, to be acceptable too; depending on $i$’s declarations.
%To our best knowledge, the philosophical literature elaborating on Rawls’ approach to reasonableness and acceptability did not investigate this point, despite its being a natural implication of the notion of acceptability. 
%This means that the notion of acceptability does not exclude the possibility that, on due reflexion, $i$ might admit that both $\prop$ and its opposite are acceptable in some cases, because in these specific cases it is possible to construct convincing arguments \emph{in utramque partem} (to use the vocabulary of Humanist \emph{ars rhetorica} \citep{skinner_reason_1996}), or because $i$ does not see significant differences between $\prop$ and $¬t$ (think about the story of Buridan’s ass).
%\end{remark}

This series of definitions determines precisely when exposure to arguments is enough to consider that someone’s stance has been formed and informed by deliberation. The formal framework thereby takes a clear position on the \emph{deliberation credentials} issue.

\subsection{A procedure to address the \emph{role of the analyst} issue}
Addressing the \emph{role of the analyst} issue, and clarifying thereby how to determine if deliberation has reached its aim in practice,  require explicitly defining a procedure to be performed by the analyst who wants to capture deliberated stances. \possessivecite{cailloux_formal_2019} framework outlines such a procedure, which consists in a process of testing \emph{models} of \acp{DJ}. A model of $i$’s \ac{DJ} (given a topic $\allprops$ and a set of arguments $\allargs$) is defined as a series of hypotheses concerning the propositions that are in $i$’s \ac{DJ} and the arguments that support these propositions in $i$’s view, together with an argumentative strategy, i.e. hypotheses concerning counter-arguments and means to counter them.

Elaborating such models is bound to be complex task, involving important theoretical and practical challenges. But let us leave aside these issues at this stage to focus on another challenge, which is more directly relevant to deliberative methods. 
The goal of a model is to capture $i$’s \ac{DJ}. Accordingly, a model is said to be \emph{valid} if $i$’s \acp{DJ} are the ones postulated by the model indeed. A major problem is then: how to determine if a given model is valid?
One cannot do that by querying $i$’s \ac{DJ} directly, since $i$ ignores his own \ac{DJ} before having performed a deliberation of the right sort, and identifying a valid model is needed to know when deliberation of the right sort has unfolded. To solve this problem, \citet{cailloux_formal_2019} introduce an \emph{operational validity} criterion, based on observable data alone, and a series of conditions which are such that, if they are fulfilled, an operationally valid model is valid (the link between validity, operational validity and the conditions is given by a theorem).

The three conditions linking operational validity to validity are \emph{Justifiable instability}; \emph{Closed under reinstatement}; and \emph{Boundedness}. \emph{Justifiable instability} mandates that $i$’s vagaries about whether she endorses a given argument can be explained by appealing to other arguments that the individual simply sometimes does not consider: when both $\ar'$ sometimes trumps $\ar$ and $\ar'$ sometimes does not trump $\ar$, it holds that some argument $\ar''$ sometimes trumps $\ar'$. 
\emph{Closed under reinstatement} mandates that if an argument $\ar_3$ always trumps another argument $\ar_2$, and $\ar_2$ sometimes trumps a third argument $\ar_1$, then there exists an argument $\ar$ in $\allargs$ which plays a similar argumentative role as $\ar_1$ (trumping all the arguments that $\ar_1$ trumps and supporting everything that $\ar_1$ supports), is not trumped by any argument that trumps $\ar_1$, and is never trumped by $\ar_2$. The idea is that $\ar$ would adopt the same argumentation as $\ar_1$ but also incorporate the reasoning of $\ar_3$, thereby preventing the attack put forward by $\ar_2$. 
Finally, \emph{Boundedness} requires that the sometimes trump relation be of bounded length (including, acyclic) and width.

The operational validity criterion is that, whenever an argument can be found to convince $i$ that he does not endorse the model’s claim, the model should be able to produce a counter-argument that $i$ will agree sometimes trumps this argument. \Citet{cailloux_formal_2019} proved that when these three conditions are met, there exists an operationally valid model, and any operationally valid model is valid. 
This theorem provides an operational way of testing a model’s claims, and thus, checking whether $i$’s \ac{DJ} has been captured.
%\begin{example}[cont.]
%	Assume that $i$ declares that $\ar_1$ indeed supports $\prop_1$. Also, according to $i$’s declaration, $\ar_2$ sometimes trumps $\ar_1$. In such a case, deciding about the operational validity of the model requires to test the answer from the model to $\ar_2$, that is, $\ar_3$. The model will be operationally valid (concerning its claim that $\prop_1$ belongs to $i$’s \ac{DJ}) if $\ar_3$ sometimes trumps $\ar_2$ and $\ar_4$ and $\ar_5$ sometimes do not trump $\ar_1$.
%\end{example}

When checking whether the operational validity criterion is satisfied, the analyst queries $i$ about whether a given argument trumps another argument, which can, in some case, involve showing to $i$ an argument that she had not thought about. The analyst therefore actively interacts with $i$, and possibly modifies $i$’s perspective as he checks the operational validity criterion. 
The procedure associated with the operational validity criterion thereby takes a clear position on the \emph{role of the analyst issue}: the role of the analyst is to interact actively with $i$ by providing her relevant arguments and counterarguments, until she has reached her \ac{DJ}.

Our proposed formal definitions and the associated procedure therefore provide a conceptual apparatus to clarify what deliberation is expected to yield, and how to make sure that it effectively did it. At this stage, a \emph{prima facie} plausible (but ultimately flawed) objection to our approach might be to claim that we introduce a uselessly sophisticated apparatus to address a trivial problem. This objection would ask: since the point of the whole apparatus is to capture people’s stance on an issue once they have considered all the relevant arguments, why not simply gather all the relevant arguments, provide them to respondent, and let them express their stance? The undeniable strength of this informal approach is its simplicity. However, far from addressing our problem with a simpler and lighter apparatus, such an approach oversimplifies what it means for a respondent to make up her mind on an issue and on relevant arguments. Indeed, although in some very simple situations, it might be possible to enlist a small series of arguments directly relevant to the issue, in all but the most trivial situations, relations between arguments and counterarguments can draw long and complex chains, and numerous arguments can find their place in various such chains. In all but the most trivial situation, the informal, supposedly simple task of showing to respondents the relevant arguments is therefore doomed to quickly become very messy, time-consuming and deeply confusing for the respondent (and perhaps even for the analyst). Our approach provides means to organize and rationalize this process.

%\begin{example}[cont.]
%	Let us illustrate the way the conditions permit to obtain validity from operational validity in our toy example. Operational validity only checks that $\ar_4$ sometimes does not trump $\ar_1$, whereas for $\prop_1$ to be effectively in $i$’s \ac{DJ}, we need that $\ar_1$ be decisive, thus, that no argument ever trumps it. But, when Justifiable instability is met, we know that, if $\ar_4$ is not itself trumped, then $\ar_4$ either always trumps, or $\ar_4$ never trumps. Because we know that $\ar_4$ sometimes does not trump, we conclude that it never trumps. Similarly, we can deduce, assuming that no argument ever trumps $\ar_3$, that $\ar_3$ always trumps $\ar_2$. Adding the observation that $\ar_2$ sometimes trumps $\ar_1$, we can apply Closed under reinstatement, and deduce the existence of an argument that also supports $\prop_1$ but that is not trumped by any more arguments than $\ar_1$ (thus, in particular, never trumped by $\ar_4$ or $\ar_5$), and also not trumped by $\ar_2$. This is the decisive argument that we look for. (This reasoning holds only under condition that $\ar_3$ and $\ar_4$ are not in turn trumped by some arguments; if they are, a more complex reasoning is required, which will involve using Closed under reinstatement repeatedly as needed to “reduce” the chains of arguments trumping each other, together with Boundedness which ensures that this process will end.)
%\end{example}

\section{Meaning and perspectives}
\label{disc}
In this section, we begin by discussing the philosophical meaning of the framework presented above, before highlighting the empirical challenges that this framework pinpoints for further developments of \ac{DMV}.

\subsection{Philosophical meaning}
The two notions of rationality and anti-paternalism, whose formalization provides the basis for the above framework, play an important role in contemporary normative philosophy. 
Indeed, the search for a compromise, an equilibrium or a satisfactory articulation between these two requirements can be seen as a key thread running through contemporary political philosophy.

A case in point is Rawls’s notion of “reflective equilibrium”. 
Following \citet{goodman_fact_1983}, \citet[][p.18]{rawls_theory_1999} used the phrase “reflective equilibrium” to refer to a “process of mutual adjustment of principles and considered judgments”. 
This formulation highlights that, in Rawls’s \emph{Theory of Justice}, this notion was intended to do justice both to people’s moral intuitions and to the need to systematize visions of justice. 
Rawls thereby granted a prominent importance to people’s own judgments (both as to how specific cases should be adjudicated and as to whether a given general principle is acceptable), which is what we termed  “anti-paternalism”. 
As for the reference to principles, and the idea that the judgments to be taken into account are the ones that can be termed “considered”, they echo our rationality requirement, if one admits that judgments are  “considered” when they are buttressed on a careful analysis of arguments and counterarguments, and that principles systematizing considered judgments provide arguments in favor of these judgments. 
Rawls’s “reflective equilibrium” hence embodies the two ideas forming the core of our concept of \ac{DJ}. 
The credibility of this interpretation is reinforced by the fact that \citeauthor{rawls_political_2005}’s \citeyearpar{rawls_political_2005} later work grants an increasing importance to the notion of “due reflection” --- a notion that does not refer to principles and is more general than the one of “reflective equilibrium”. 

This broader philosophical perspective also usefully points to another important debate. 
A prominent aspect of the concept of reflective equilibrium that our reasoning has so far set aside is its purported interpersonal dimension. 
In \emph{A Theory of Justice}, the reflective equilibrium is not presented as the result of the endeavor of an insulated individual, but is rather defined from the very beginning in collective terms. 
Similarly, when Rawls makes use of the concept in \emph{Political Liberalism}, he presents it as a  “device of representation” that citizens can use to calibrate their public discussions. 
Like many other key concepts of the Rawlsian framework, the one of reflective equilibrium is hence systematically presented by Rawls in pluri-individual settings --- another example in Rawls’s \emph{Theory of Justice} is the “parties” choosing the principles of justice, which are unequivocally presented as a collective. 
At first sight one might object to our approach that it lacks such an interpersonal dimension.
If true, this would be a worrying weakness, especially given that some authors such as \citet{vatn_institutional_2009} argue that one of the distinctive strengths of deliberative approaches is that they lead people to reason according to “We-rationality”, as opposed to “I-rationality”. 
It is therefore important to stress how the interpersonal dimension comes into play in our approach.

\possessivecite{habermas_moralbewustsein_1983} approach is of particular significance from our point of view. \citet{habermas_short_1999} famously argued that Rawls’s approach involved a preemption, by the philosopher, of issues that have their proper place in public debates among citizens (this objection could be reformulated as stating that Rawls’s answer to the \emph{role of the analyst issue} is dubious).
\citet{habermas_moralbewustsein_1983} claims he overcomes this limitation because, in his approach, the content of the theory of justice is not the result of an explicit deliberation or reflection, but rather the result of a transcendental deduction (though of a weaker sort that the Kantian one) --- that is, they are demonstrated to be conditions of possibility of all sorts of interactions mediated by communication in a society. As opposed to these so-called “moral” tenets, a given “ethical” notion can be consensually accepted in a given society or group, but can become a bone of contention when various groups meet or merge. 
Thus, in this approach, there can exist a dissensus between various individuals in the society on many issues. 
But when it comes to the subject matter of moral theory, any dissensus is bound to be ephemeral, because the very process of communication through which people try to settle their disagreements presupposes an implicit acceptance of the tenets that moral theory aims to capture. However, Habermas’s purported solution through a transcendantal deduction has itself been criticized \citep{heath_communicative_2001}. 
In particular, it is not self-evident that there is such a thing as a determinate set of conditions of possibility common to all sorts of interactions mediated by communication in a society. 
Habermas’s theory hence appears to be plagued by the same problem that he denounced in Rawls’s theory: both wanted to prove that consensus will occur on certain issues, but none of them achieved to do it without surreptitiously taking a questionable stance on the \emph{role of the analyst issue}. %Rawls only provided conceptual reasons to believe that the “considered judgments” of various individuals in a society should converge towards an “overlapping consensus”, and these concepual reasons fail to win over everyone, even among philosophers largely inspired by Rawls \citep{estlund_insularity_1998, estlund_democratic_2009}. 
%Similarly Habermas’s theory is weakened by the fact that its fixed point (the content of moral theory, the so-called “U” and “D” tenets \citep{habermas_moralbewustsein_1983}) is a purely conceptual finding that happens to arouse conceptual criticisms.

Our approach turns the question of existence of a consensus into an empirical one. Consensus is achievable, without taking a questionable stance on the role of the analyst issue, in the situations where a consensual \ac{DJ} can be obtained by all individuals in the society on a specific issue, or, a consensual \ac{DJ} can be obtained on the higher-order issue of the procedure used to resolve lower-orders disagreements. \commentOCf{On pourrait préciser ici au passage que ça permet d’éviter d’appliquer une procédure d’aggrégation choisie arbitrairement telle que l’addition des WTP, si tu tiens à tackler nos amis, mais il faut être prudent pour éviter les remarques du type le WTP est additif par définition.} \commentYM{ça me parait bien comme ça}Future studies should tackle the difficult application of our proposal systematically to the study of social decision making, rather than individual decision making.

Based on the same logic, our approach also opens avenues to investigate empirically the conditions that are liable to have an influence on the stance that individual take on a given issue, once they have taken into account all the relevant arguments and counterarguments. Indeed, our framework is designed to make sure that the individual involved is exposed to all the relevant arguments and counter-arguments, but our prototypical protocol does not monitor all the aspects of the individual's psychological live that can have an influence on how s/he \emph{takes into account} these arguments and counter-arguments. Some contextual elements, such as for example whether or not the individual trusts the analyst with whom s/he works, or whether the overall setting encourages sincere discussions, might have an influence of the way the individual will take this or that argument into account. If it indeed turns out to be the case, such a context-dependence can raise doubts on the very idea that taking all the arguments and counter-arguments into account has a major normative force. This empirical question therefore has major bearings for conceptual investigations on the normative significance of requirements such as the one of rationality, as we have defined it in this article.

 

\commentYM{je ne me souvenais plus de la phrase ci-dessous, qui me semble bateau et inutile}
Furthermore, similarly to most philosophers and analysts, we do not claim, of course, that consensus can be achieved on all matters, and our proposal is no magical means to solve every disagreement in the world.

%Our approach ventures an alternative solution to this problem. We have to face the fact that, in situations in which various people diverge in their considered judgments, collective deliberation and decision-making unavoidably face issues of aggregation of diverging attitudes. 
%One cannot simply take this idea as a mandate to accept the divergence of preferences and additively aggregate them, as \citet{bartkowski_beyond_2018} suggest. If people disagree on an issue they tackle, and if they do not agree that their disagreements should be resolved by additively aggregating their divergent attitudes, then the additive aggregation grants a dubious role to the analyst, to say the least.

%Seriously tackling this problem therefore requires addressing, upstream any \ac{DMV}, the empirical question of whether people diverge in their \acp{DJ} on the topic at hand, and if they do diverge, the additional empirical question of whether they converge in their \acp{DJ} concerning how their diverging \acp{DJ} should be aggregated. 

\subsection{Empirical challenges for the future of \ac{DMV}}
%Like any method, \ac{DMV} and other deliberative methods have a restricted domain of application, and any application of these methods should therefore start by checking if it indeed falls within its domain of application. 
%For such a verification, an empirical approach is needed. 
%Both Rawls, Habermas, Sen and the \ac{DMV} literature as a whole lack such an approach. 

The precise definition of \acp{DJ}, together with the procedure outlined in the framework above, provide the building blocs to develop the empirical studies needed to address the empirical questions pinpointed just above, which are key to a rigorous applications of \ac{DMV} but are currently ignored in the literature.

%open an avenue of research aiming to detect which protocols of deliberation better achieve the goal of capturing the participants’ \ac{DJ}.
%Though the concrete details of such empirical studies fall beyond the scope of the present article, our framework spelled out above provides a backbone for such an approach.

However, the above framework remains highly abstract, and numerous empirical challenges still need to be addressed to translate it into concrete protocols. Let us flesh out the most prominent of these empirical challenges, which should, in our view, constitute the core of future studies designed to strengthen the credentials of \ac{DMV} and other deliberative approaches. 

The strength of the above theorem is that it allows to say something about $i$’s \ac{DJ} despite the fact that directly identifying $i$’s \ac{DJ} is hopeless. 
But this strength has a price: it holds only if the associated conditions are met. 
Therefore, in order to understand if and how \acp{DJ} can be empirically captured, it is crucial to ponder on the meaning of these conditions.

%\emph{A first thing to notice in this respect is that one cannot realistically expect that real-life decision situations will fulfill these conditions. Fortunately, these conditions can be weakened substantially, by distinguishing $\allargs$ from the restricted set of arguments $\args$ with which the analyst works in practice. This allows to define conditions whose meaning is very similar to the one of the simple conditions spelled out above, but which are more realistic because they refer to a restricted set of arguments. We refer to \citet{cailloux_formal_2019} for a complete exposition of the technicalities involved. Because the weaker and simpler conditions have very similar meanings, we can content ourselves with a discussion of the simple conditions here.} 

From an empirical perspective, these conditions can be interpreted in two different ways, which call for two deeply different empirical approaches:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\emph{\roman*}, ref=\emph{\roman*}]
		\item \label{inter:empir} As empirical hypotheses;
	\item \label{inter:rules} As rules governing the decision support process (rules that $i$ can commit to abide by, or can consider to be well-founded safeguards for the proper unfolding of the process).
\end{enumerate}

If the conditions are understood as empirical hypotheses, the empirical challenge is to be able to empirically test them. If they are understood as rules (\ref{inter:rules}), the empirical challenge is to design institutions and procedures whose functioning ensures that the conditions are met. These two challenges come on top of two other, even more fundamental, empirical challenges: the one of identifying the empirically relevant set of arguments with which the analyst will have to work in practice, and the one of empirically elaborating models of deliberated judgments (which should ideally have some degree of generality)  and test them using the operational validity criterion.

To sum up, in this article, we have shown that the theoretical underpinnings of \ac{DMV} are still plagued by two blind spots: the lack of a clear position on the \emph{role of the deliberation} and the \emph{role of the analyst} issues. We have proposed a framework addressing both issues, thereby strengthening the theoretical foundations of \ac{DMV} and other deliberative approaches.  But we have also shown that this framework points major empirical challenges that deliberative methods should now address to entrench their credentials.
 

%That said, to conclude, we have to emphasize that, despite the promises offered by our framework, this is no magical tool. 
%In particular, we do not claim that it overcomes Hume’s law by providing the means to deduce ought from is. 
%As repeatedly emphasised, our approach is anchored in two unmistakably normative tenets: rationality and anti-paternalism. %Our reasoning in \cref{disc} was devoted to show that these two tenets play a very fundamental role in contemporary normative philosophy, and can therefore in that very specific sense be considered minimal. 
%But one could accordingly argue that the criticism that we address at Habermas also applies to our framework, one step deeper. This is certainly true. 
%We do not claim that it solves all the philosophical difficulties of the theory of deliberative democracy, \ac{DMV} and their foundations. 
%We rather attempted to introduce an approach that allows to go deeper than the current literature in the direction of providing strong philosophical foundations to empirical applications of philosophies of deliberation, such as \ac{DMV}.
