	abstract = {We present a new method, called UTA-GMS, for multiple criteria ranking of alternatives from set A using a set of additive value functions which result from an ordinal regression. The preference information provided by the decision maker is a set of pairwise comparisons on a subset of alternatives A{\textasciicircum}R {\textbackslash}subseteq A, called reference alternatives. The preference model built via ordinal regression is the set of all additive value functions compatible with the preference information. Using this model, one can define two relations in the set A: the necessary weak preference relation which holds for any two alternatives a,b from set A if and only if for all compatible value functions a is preferred to b, and the possible weak preference relation which holds for this pair if and only if for at least one compatible value function a is preferred to b. These relations establish a necessary and a possible ranking of alternatives from A, being, respectively, a partial preorder and a strongly complete relation. The UTA-GMS method is intended to be used interactively, with an increasing subset A{\textasciicircum}R and a progressive statement of pairwise comparisons. When no preference information is provided, the necessary weak preference relation is a weak dominance relation, and the possible weak preference relation is a complete relation. Every new pairwise comparison of reference alternatives, for which the dominance relation does not hold, is enriching the necessary relation and it is impoverishing the possible relation, so that they converge with the growth of the preference information. Distinguishing necessary and possible consequences of preference information on the complete set of actions, UTA-GMS answers questions of robustness analysis. Moreover, the method can support the decision maker when his/her preference statements cannot be represented in terms of an additive value function. The method is illustrated by an example solved using the UTA-GMS software. Some extensions of the method are also presented},

In persuasion dialogues two or more participants try to resolve a conflict of opinion, each trying to persuade the other participants to adopt their point of view. Dialogue systems for persuasion regulate how such dialogues can be conducted and what their outcome is. Good dialogue systems ensure that conflicts of view can be resolved in a fair and effective way [6]. The term ‘persuasion dialogue’ was coined by Walton [13] as part of his influential classification of dialogues into six types according to their goal. While persuasion aims to resolve a difference of opinion, negotiation tries to resolve a conflict of interest by reaching a deal, information seeking aims at transferring information, deliberationdeliberation wants to reach a decision on a course of action, inquiry is aimed at “growth of knowledge and agreement” and quarrel is the verbal substitute of a fight. This classification leaves room for shifts of dialogues of one type to another. In particular, other types of dialogues can shift to persuasion when a conflict of opinion arises. For example, in information-seeking a conflict of opinion could arise on the credibility of a source of information, in deliberation the participants may disagree about likely effects of plans or actions and in negotiation they may disagree about the reasons why a proposal is in one’s interest.},

An alternative criterion of adequacy called i.d.e.-adequacy is formulated. This criterion takes seriously the idea that defeasible reasoning may involve indefinitely many cycles of retracting and reinstating conclusions. It is shown how to construct a reasoner that, subject to certain realistic assumptions, is provably i.d.e.-adequate. The most recent version of OSCAR implements this system, and examples are given of OSCAR's operation.},

Approaches which solve the latter task involve a semi-formal pattern of documenting the reasons for and against each of the options, but they generally do not allow an automation of the decision making process. Approaches which solve the former task use a mathematical model of the problem, in which each option is evaluated numerically with respect to some relevant criteria, but they do not support documentation. We investigate the use of argumentation to both analyse and document decisions, solving both tasks with the same method. Additionally, the system we present is able to generate decisions for analysis, instead of relying on a predefined input of options. We collaborated with an aerospace manufacturer to identify common problems in the industry and to create realistic examples from the engineering domain. We show that our system subsumes a certain class of multi criteria decision making problems and that it improves upon previous argumentation-based decision making systems by adding the capability to generate decisions and by clearly defining the semantics used to choose accepted arguments.},

	abstract = {Dung’s argumentation system takes as input a set of arguments and a binary relation encoding attacks among these arguments, and returns different extensions of arguments. However, no indication is given on how to instantiate this setting, i.e. how to build arguments from a knowledge base and how to choose an appropriate attack relation. This leads in some cases to undesirable results like inconsistent extensions (i.e. the set of formulas forming an extension is inconsistent). This is due to the gap between the abstract setting and the knowledge base from which it is defined. The purpose of this paper is twofold: First it proposes to fill in this gap by extending Dung’s system. The idea is to consider all the ingredients involved in an argumentation problem. We start with an abstract monotonic logic which consists of a set of formulas and a consequence operator. We show how to build arguments from a knowledge base using the consequence operator of the logic. Second, we show that the choice of an attack relation is crucial for ensuring consistent results, and should not be arbitrary. In particular, we argue that an attack relation should be at least grounded on the minimal conflicts contained in the knowledge base. Moreover, due to the binary character of this relation, some attack relations may lead to unintended results. Namely, symmetric relations are not suitable when ternary (or more) minimal conflicts are in the knowledge base. We propose then the characteristics of attack relations that ensure sound results.},

We provide some basic definitions for arguments, and various kinds of counter-arguments (defeaters). This leads us to the definition of canonical undercuts which we argue are the only defeaters that we need to take into account. We then motivate and formalise the notion of argument trees and argument structures which provide a way of exhaustively collating arguments and counter-arguments. We use argument structures as the basis of our general proposal for argument aggregation. There are a number of frameworks for modelling argumentation in logic. They incorporate formal representation of individual arguments and techniques for comparing conflicting arguments. In these frameworks, if there are a number of arguments for and against a particular conclusion, an aggregation function determines whether the conclusion is taken to hold. We propose a generalisation of these frameworks. In particular, our new framework makes it possible to define aggregation functions that are sensitive to the number of arguments for or against. We compare our framework with a number of other types of argument systems, and finally discuss an application in reasoning with structured news reports.},

	abstract = {Arguments play two different roles in day life decisions, as well as in the discussion of more crucial issues. Namely, they help to select one or several alternatives, or to explain and justify an already adopted choice. This paper proposes the first general and abstract argument-based framework for decision making. This framework follows two main steps. At the first step, arguments for beliefs and arguments for options are built and evaluated using classical acceptability semantics. At the second step, pairs of options are compared using decision principles. Decision principles are based on the accepted arguments supporting the options. Three classes of decision principles are distinguished: unipolar, bipolar or non-polar principles depending on whether i) only arguments pros or only arguments cons, or ii) both types, or iii) an aggregation of them into a meta-argument are used. The abstract model is then instantiated by expressing formally the mental states (beliefs and preferences) of a decision maker. In the proposed framework, information is given in the form of a stratified set of beliefs. The bipolar nature of preferences is emphasized by making an explicit distinction between prioritized goals to be pursued, and prioritized rejections that are stumbling blocks to be avoided. A typology that identifies four types of argument is proposed. Indeed, each decision is supported by arguments emphasizing its positive consequences in terms of goals certainly satisfied and rejections certainly avoided. A decision can also be attacked by arguments emphasizing its negative consequences in terms of certainly missed goals, or rejections certainly led to by that decision. Finally, this paper articulates the optimistic and pessimistic decision criteria defined in qualitative decision making under uncertainty, in terms of an argumentation process. Similarly, different decision principles identified in multiple criteria decision making are restated in our argumentation-based framework.},

We take these characteristics of decision making as a given but argue that it is problematic to conclude that they typically represent departures from rationality. The very psychological processes that lead to “irrational” decisions (e.g., framing, mental accounting) continue to exert their influence when one experiences the results of the decisions. That is, psychological processes that affect decisions may be said also to “leak” into one's experience. The implication is that formal principles of rationality do not provide a good enough normative standard against which to assess decision making. Instead, what is needed is a substantive theory of rationality—one that takes subjective experience seriously, considers both direct and indirect consequences of particular decisions, considers how particular decisions fit into life as a whole, and considers the effects of decisions on others. Formal principles may play a role as approximations of the substantive theory that can be used by theorists and decision makers in cases in which the formal principles can capture most of the relevant considerations and leakage into experience is negligible.},

	abstract = {This paper presents two approximate methods for multiattribute utility measurement, SMARTS and SMARTER, each based on an elicitation procedure for weights. Both correct an error in SMART, originally proposed by Edwards in 1977, and in addition SMARTER is simpler to use. SMARTS uses linear approximations to single-dimension utility functions, an additive aggregation model, and swing weights. The paper proposes tests for the usability of these approximations. SMARTER, based on a formally justifiable weighting procedure developed by Barron and Barrett, uses the same procedures as SMARTS except that it omits the second of two elicitation steps in swing weights, substituting calculations based on ranks. It can be shown to perform about 98\% as well as SMARTS does, without requiring any difficult judgments from elicitees.},

	abstract = {Evaluative arguments are pervasive in natural human communication. In countless situations people attempt to advise or persuade their interlocutors that something is desirable (vs. undesirable) or right (vs. wrong). With the proliferation of on-line systems serving as personal advisors and assistants, there is a pressing need to develop general and testable computational models for generating and presenting evaluative arguments. Previous research on generating evaluative arguments has been characterized by two major limitations. First, researchers have tended to focus only on specific aspects of the generation process. Second, the proposed approaches were not empirically tested. The research presented in this paper addresses both limitations. We have designed and implemented a complete computational model for generating evaluative arguments. For content selection and organization, we devised an argumentation strategy based on guidelines from argumentation theory. For expressing the content in natural language, we extended and integrated previous work in computational linguistics on generating evaluative arguments. The key knowledge source for both tasks is a quantitative model of user preferences. To empirically test critical aspects of our generation model, we have devised and implemented an evaluation framework in which the effectiveness of evaluative arguments can be measured with real users. Within the framework, we have performed an experiment to test two basic hypotheses on which the design of the computational model is based; namely, that our proposal for tailoring an evaluative argument to the addressee's preferences increases its effectiveness, and that differences in conciseness significantly influence argument effectiveness. The second hypothesis was confirmed in the experiment. In contrast, the first hypothesis was only marginally confirmed. However, independent testing by other researchers has recently provided further support for this hypothesis.},

The theory is illustrated by many real concrete examples taken from a host of disciplinary settings. The standard approach in decision theory or decision analysis specifies a simplified single objective like monetary return to maximize. By generalizing from the single objective case to the multiple objective case, this book considerably widens the range of applicability of decision analysis.},

	abstract = {Belief revision always results in trusting new evidence, so it may admit an unreliable one and discard a more confident one. We therefore use belief change instead of belief revision to remedy this weakness. By introducing  epistemic states, we take into account of the strength of evidence that influences the change of belief. In this paper, we present a set of postulates to characterize belief change by epistemic states and establish representation  theorems to characterize those postulates. We show that from an epistemic state, a corresponding ordinal conditional function by Spohn can be derived and the result of combining two epistemic states is thus reduced to the result from combining two corresponding ordinal conditional functions proposed by Laverny and Lang. Furthermore, when reduced to the belief revision situation, we prove that our results induce all the Darwiche and Pearl's postulates.},

The typical approach within social choice theory is to assess these theories in an axiomatic way - most of the time the reader is confronted with abstract reasoning and logical deductions. This book shows that empirical insights are necessary if one wants to apply any theory of justice in the real world. It does so by confronting the main theories of distributive justice with data from (mostly) questionnaire experiments. The book starts with an extensive discussion on why empirical social choice makes sense and how it should be done. It then presents various experimental results relating to theories of distributive justice, including the Rawlsian equity axiom, Harsanyi's version of utilitarianism, utilitarianism with a floor, responsibility-sensitive egalitarianism, the claims problem and fairness in health.},
